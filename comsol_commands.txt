ALLOWING EXTERNAL PROCESSES IN THE COMMAND LINE
---Add the flag -allowexternalmatlab on to the COMSOL start-up command to enable external processes.

ACTIVATING THE PROGRESS BAR
---By default no progress information is displayed while running COMSOL with MATLAB. 
---To manually enable a progress bar and visualize the progress of operations, enter the command: 
ModelUtil.showProgress(true)

THE MODEL HISTORY
---The model history is automatically enabled when the model is created in the COMSOL Desktop. 
---It is however possible to manually disable the model history recording from the MATLAB prompt with the command: 
model.hist.disable
---The functions mphload and mphopen automatically disable model history when loading a model.

COMPACTING THE MODEL HISTORY
---To compact the model history in the COMSOL Desktop, from File menu, select Compact History ().
---To compact the model history at the MATLAB prompt enter the command: model.resetHist

LOADING A MODEL AT THE MATLAB PROMPT
---If you do not want to update the recent opened file list with the model you are about to open, use the -nostore flag with the function mphopen as in the command below:
model = mphopen(<filename>, <ModelTag>, '-nostore')

DISABLING MODEL FEATURE UPDATE
---Every time a setting in changed in a model COMSOL Multiphysics automatically checks the settings for that particular feature and updates any other feature
that may depend on the new setting. 
---To disable the feature model update enter the command:
model.disableUpdates(true)
---You have to enable the feature update again prior to computing the solution in order to make sure that COMSOL works on an updated model definition. 
---To enable the feature model update, enter the command:
model.disableUpdates(false)

STARTING COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS SERVER ON LINUX
---In a system terminal prompt start a COMSOL Multiphysics server with the command:
comsol mphserver

CONNECTING MATLAB TO THE COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS SERVER ON LINUX
---In MATLAB, add the path of the COMSOL5.4a/mli directory. 
---Enter this command at the MATLAB prompt:
mphstart
---Once MATLAB and the COMSOL server are manually connected, import the COMSOL class by entering the following command:
import com.comsol.model.util.*
---To disconnect MATLAB and the COMSOL server, run this command at the MATLAB prompt:
ModelUtil.disconnect;

SWITCH OFF SAVING OF RECOVERY FILES
---In a command window, execute
/opt/comsol/5.4/bin/comsol server -autosave 'off'
/opt/comsol/5.4/bin/comsol mphserver -tmpdir $TMPDIR$ -recoverydir $RECDIR$ -autosave 'off'
